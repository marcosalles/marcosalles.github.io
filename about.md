My name is Marco, but call me Szas. I am weird.

I learned programming by myself while coursing Architecture @ USP and fell immediately in love with everything related. I dropped the course and applied to a Computer Information Systems course also @ USP while already working as an intern for a mobile apps startup.

I currently work as a web developer at [Caelum](http://www.caelum.com.br)/[Casa do CÃ³digo](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br) and I love my job and everyone at the office. It's a great team with very interesting and capable people where I fell I can still learn a lot.

I'm a devoted gamer, with hours spent on *World of Warcraft*, *Left 4 Dead 2*, *Diablo III* and *League of Legends*. My favorite games are all for the best console of all time: the SNES. They are *TLoZ: A Link to the past*, *Chrono Trigger* and *Super Mario World*).

I like to create automation scripts on my free time.
